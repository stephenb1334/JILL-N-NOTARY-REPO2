## FLORIDA ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### Legal Requirements for Florida LLCs

Florida law establishes distinct requirements for business addresses that directly impacted West Coast Notaries, LLC's compliance status:

1. **Principal Office Address Requirements:**
   - Must be a physical street address
   - Cannot be a PO Box or postal service street addressing alternative
   - Must be capable of receiving service of process
   - Must be listed on all state filings and registrations

2. **Mailing Address Requirements:**
   - Can be a PO Box
   - Used for routine business correspondence
   - Separate designation from principal address

3. **Registered Agent Address Requirements:**
   - Must be a physical Florida street address
   - Must be staffed during normal business hours
   - Cannot be a PO Box or mail service

### Previous Non-Compliance Details

Based on Florida Division of Corporations (Sunbiz) records, West Coast Notaries, LLC previously utilized a USPS location as its principal business address. This arrangement violated Florida business regulations because:

1. PO Boxes cannot serve as principal business addresses under Florida Statutes
2. USPS street addressing alternatives (physical post office address + box number) are readily identifiable by government agencies as non-residential mail services
3. Florida Division of Corporations specifically requires legitimate physical addresses for principal office designations

This non-compliance created potential legal vulnerabilities including:
- Risk of administrative dissolution
- Rejection of annual reports or other filings
- Complications with service of process
- Potential administrative penalties

### Current Compliance Status

As of January 11, 2025, West Coast Notaries, LLC successfully remediated its address compliance issues by:
1. Establishing a physical office location at 1071 Donegan Rd STE 315, Largo, FL 33771
2. Properly filing change of address documentation with Florida authorities
3. Maintaining separation between principal and mailing addresses as needed

## ADDRESS PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

While maintaining regulatory compliance, we understand businesses often have legitimate privacy concerns regarding address disclosure. The following strategic options provide compliant alternatives to using personal residential addresses:

### Compliant Address Alternatives

1. **Virtual Business Address Services:**
   - Professional services providing physical address + mail handling
   - Typically include mail forwarding or scanning
   - Often offer additional business services
   - COMPLIANCE LEVEL: HIGH (if properly structured)

2. **Private Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies:**
   - Services like UPS Store providing physical address with suite number
   - Distinguished from USPS PO Boxes in government systems
   - Accepted by most regulatory authorities
   - COMPLIANCE LEVEL: HIGH

3. **Coworking/Shared Office Space:**
   - Physical office presence with dedicated address
   - Often includes mail handling and reception services
   - Professional business environment
   - COMPLIANCE LEVEL: VERY HIGH

4. **Registered Agent Services with Address Provisions:**
   - Combined registered agent and business address services
   - Specialized in regulatory compliance
   - Often include mail forwarding and document management
   - COMPLIANCE LEVEL: VERY HIGH
