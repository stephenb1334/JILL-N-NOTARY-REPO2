Based on the information provided in the two images, I can make the following determination:
	1.	West Coast Notaries, LLC has changed its address between 2024 and 2025.
	2.	In 2024, the company was using an address that appears to be a USPS location: 4122 MADISON ST. #452, ELFERS, FL 34680
	3.	As of January 11, 2025, the company changed its address to: 1071 Donegan Rd STE 315, Largo, FL 33771
	4.	The use of a USPS address (likely a PO Box with street addressing) as the principal place of business in 2024 was likely not compliant with Florida business registration requirements, which typically require a physical street address.
	5.	The current address (as of 2025) appears to be a legitimate physical location, possibly in a residential or mixed-use area, which would likely be compliant with Florida’s requirements for a principal place of business.
	6.	The company has made efforts to update its registration and bring its address into compliance with state regulations.
	7.	The change of address and registered agent information suggests the company is actively managing its corporate records and attempting to maintain good standing with the Florida Division of Corporations.
In conclusion, while the company may have been in violation of address use requirements in 2024, they appear to have taken steps to correct this issue in 2025 by updating their address to a physical location.

LC AMENDMENT: Here, "LC" stands for Limited Company, indicating that the amendment pertains to a Limited Liability Company. An "AMENDMENT" usually signifies a formal change made to the company's articles of organization or operational structure. This could involve various changes such as modifications to the company name, address, registered agent, or other operational details. The fact that this is noted as the "Last Event" implies it was the most recent official documentation filed with the state.
