## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents findings from a comprehensive trademark audit conducted for West Coast Notaries, LLC, a Florida-based entity. The audit evaluates multiple scenarios regarding potential trademark usage, eligibility, and infringement risks at both federal (USPTO) and state (Florida Division of Corporations) levels.

1. "West Coast Notaries" presents **LOW-MODERATE RISK** as a service mark with viable registration pathways
2. "Go-Pro Notaries" variations present **HIGH RISK (7-8/10)** with significant likelihood of opposition and enforcement
3. Florida state registration offers more accessible protection but limited scope compared to federal registration
4. Strategic branding alternatives could minimize risk while maximizing protection

**Immediate Recommendation:** Prioritize "West Coast Notaries" branding strategy and avoid "Go-Pro" variations due to high litigation risk.

## BUSINESS IDENTITY STRUCTURE

### Confirmed Entity Name
- West Coast Notaries, LLC (Florida-registered entity)

### Potential DBA / Service Mark Scenarios
- **Scenario 1:** Using entity name "West Coast Notaries" as service mark
- **Scenario 2:** Using variations of "Go-Pro Notaries" as service mark:
  - Go-Pro Notaries
  - Go-Pro Notaries
  - GoPro Notaries

*Note: The domain "gopronotaries.com" is the only reference point available regarding potential "Go-Pro" branding. WHOIS research shows the domain was acquired in 2020 but currently has an "Inactive" site status. All analyses are based on the assumption that variations of "Go Pro Notaries" were not used during 2020-2024 and are intended for future use in 2025, as no other documentation references these variations.*

## TRADEMARK AUDIT FINDINGS

### SCENARIO 1: Using "West Coast Notaries" as Service Mark

#### Federal (USPTO) Analysis:
- No existing federal trademark registrations or applications found for "West Coast Notaries" or "West Coast Notary"
- Descriptive/geographic terms face inherent distinctiveness challenges under USPTO examination
- May qualify for Supplemental Register immediately; Principal Register with acquired distinctiveness
- Comparable geographic service marks have succeeded with proper differentiation

**Federal Eligibility Assessment:** MODERATE - Potential pathway to registration with proper strategy and evidence.

#### Florida State Analysis:
- Florida Division of Corporations search reveals no direct conflicts
- Most similar "West Coast" marks show inactive status
- State registration standards typically less stringent for geographic/descriptive terms
- Provides immediate Florida-specific protection while building federal case

**Florida State Eligibility Assessment:** FAVORABLE - State registration appears viable with minimal obstacles.

### SCENARIO 2: Using "Go-Pro Notaries" Variations as Service Mark

#### Federal (USPTO) Analysis:
- "GoPro" is a well-established, actively enforced famous trademark (GoPro, Inc.)
- USPTO likely to reject based on Section 2(d) likelihood of confusion
- Potential dilution claims under Section 43(c) for famous mark
- Service differentiation (notary vs. cameras) unlikely to overcome similarity concerns
- Descriptive term "Notaries" provides minimal additional distinctiveness

**Federal Risk Assessment: HIGH (7-8/10)**
- Registration likelihood: VERY LOW
- Legal challenge likelihood if used: HIGH
- Established pattern of aggressive trademark enforcement by GoPro, Inc.

#### Florida State Analysis:
- No exact matches in state registration database
- State registration provides no immunity from federal trademark claims
- Even with successful state registration, federal enforcement risk remains high
- State examiners may still reject based on similarity to famous marks

**Florida State Risk Assessment: HIGH (6-7/10)**
- Limited protection value even if registered
- Federal enforcement vulnerability remains regardless of state status

## MULTI-SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### Scenario A: Entity Uses "West Coast Notaries" as Service Mark
- **Federal Registration:** Challenging but achievable with proper strategy
- **State Registration:** High probability of success
- **Risk Level:** LOW-MODERATE
- **Key Challenges:** Proving distinctiveness for geographic/descriptive combination
- **Strategic Value:** Builds on established entity name; minimal transition costs

### Scenario B: Entity Uses "Go-Pro Notaries" Variations as Service Mark
- **Federal Registration:** Highly unlikely to succeed
- **State Registration:** Limited protection value even if successful
- **Risk Level:** HIGH (potential for cease and desist, litigation)
- **Key Challenges:** Strong similarity to famous mark with established enforcement history
- **Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on the existence of the domain "gopronotaries.com" acquired in 2020 but showing "Inactive" status as of February 2025, and assumes planned future use beginning in 2025 with no commercial usage during 2020-2024

### Scenario C: Entity Uses Hybrid Approach
- **Implementation:** "West Coast Notaries" as primary mark with distinctive logo/design
- **Risk Level:** VARIABLE (depends on execution)
- **Registration Strategy:** State-first approach while building federal distinctiveness evidence
- **Key Advantage:** Balances protection with practical business considerations

### Scenario D: Entity Develops New Distinctive Branding
- **Implementation:** Create entirely new, inherently distinctive service mark
- **Risk Level:** LOW (assuming proper clearance)
- **Registration Strategy:** Direct federal Principal Register application
- **Key Advantage:** Strongest long-term protection; eliminates identified risks

## DETAILED LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

### "West Coast Notaries" Legal Framework:
1. **Geographic Descriptiveness (Section 2(e)(2)):**
   - Primary USPTO obstacle for geographic terms
   - Five years continuous use can support acquired distinctiveness
   - Supplemental Register provides immediate benefits while building distinctive character
   - Design elements can enhance distinctiveness

2. **Distinctiveness Enhancement Strategies:**
   - Add unique design elements/logo
   - Document consistent commercial usage
   - Compile advertising/marketing evidence
   - Consider adding non-descriptive terms

3. **Registration Pathway:**
   - State registration as immediate protection
   - Federal Supplemental Register as intermediate step
   - Federal Principal Register with Section 2(f) evidence as ultimate goal

### "Go-Pro Notaries" Legal Framework:
1. **Likelihood of Confusion Analysis (DuPont Factors):**
   - Similarity of marks: HIGH
   - Relatedness of goods/services: LOW
   - Strength of prior mark: VERY HIGH (famous mark)
   - Channels of trade: POTENTIALLY OVERLAPPING
   - Buyer sophistication: MODERATE
   - Intent factor: REQUIRES CLARIFICATION

2. **Dilution Considerations:**
   - Protection for famous marks transcends service categories
   - No requirement to prove consumer confusion
   - Potential damages and injunctive relief
   - Limited statutory defenses for trademark dilution

3. **Risk Mitigation Limitations:**
   - Disclaimer of affiliation likely insufficient
   - Design differentiation unlikely to overcome name similarity
   - Different service category provides minimal protection

## FLORIDA-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### State Registration Process:
- Application through Florida Department of State Division of Corporations
- $87.50 filing fee per classification
- 5-year registration term with renewal option
- Use-in-commerce requirement within Florida
- Less stringent examination standards than USPTO

### Florida Protection Scope:
- Limited to Florida state boundaries
- Creates presumption of ownership within state
- Does not prevent federal infringement claims
- Does not preclude common law trademark claims
- Provides standing for state-level enforcement

### Federal vs. Florida Strategy:
- Complementary rather than alternative approaches
- State registration provides immediate protection while building federal case
- State rights can establish priority date for federal purposes
- Both registrations recommended for comprehensive protection

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on our comprehensive multi-scenario analysis, we recommend:

1. **Primary Recommendation:**
   - **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** stepping back to engage in a thoughtful, comprehensive branding development process
   - Consult with both a trademark attorney AND a professional branding specialist before finalizing any decision
   - Investment in professional branding guidance now can prevent costly legal issues and rebranding later
   - A strategically developed brand identity can provide stronger legal protection while better positioning your services in the marketplace

2. **Regarding "Go-Pro Notaries" Variations:**
   - **URGENT:** Avoid use of all "Go-Pro" variations due to high litigation risk
   - Recommend domain migration strategy from gopronotaries.com before any public-facing launch
   - Based on domain registration from 2020 with "Inactive" status and recent update in February 2025, there appears to be no established commercial use creating trademark rights
   - The 5-year period of domain ownership without active usage provides no substantial trademark rights or defenses
   - Preventative measures are significantly more cost-effective than potential litigation

3. **Strategic Branding Roadmap:**
   - **Immediate Term (0-3 months):**
     - Engage professional branding consultant to evaluate market positioning
     - Conduct comprehensive competitive analysis of notary service branding
     - Develop strategic branding options that balance distinctiveness with business objectives
     - Secure Florida state registration for selected branding
   
   - **Medium Term (3-12 months):**
     - Implement consistent branding across all channels
     - Document commercial usage and recognition
     - Consider federal Supplemental Register application if appropriate
   
   - **Long Term (12+ months):**
     - Build case for acquired distinctiveness
     - Pursue federal Principal Register registration
     - Consider strategic trademark portfolio expansion

4. **Professional Consultation Priority:**
   - Trademark attorney consultation (legal protection strategy)
   - Branding specialist (market positioning and distinction)
   - Digital marketing consultant (domain strategy and online presence)
   - Industry association resources (notary-specific considerations)

5. **Alternative Consideration:** 
   - Consider using the formal entity name "West Coast Notaries" as your doing business name
   - This approach offers the lowest risk profile while maintaining brand consistency with your established legal identity
   - Florida state registration for this mark presents minimal obstacles and immediate protection
