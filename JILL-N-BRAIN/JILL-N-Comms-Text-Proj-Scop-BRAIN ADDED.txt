Here's the exact conversation with redundancies removed:

**Steve (Blue):**
Hi jill, spoke to John. I made you a couple prototype notary sites to look at. I've spent a lot of time studying new coding development approaches and have gotten fast and really like the craft. I'll send links soon.

I plugged in dummy data to fill the gaps but do you have a name for your notary entity/service that you like or logo or still forming those formally?

John said you're not new to doing notary services and you had a focus on residential realty/closings. Any other details you can share? I can include those in the first versions of a few drafts I send you way

**Jill (Black):**
I am so grateful üòä tysm

Sounds good. What's your timeline and urgency? Just to know. I'd love to be the one to hit a home run for you on this and can manage it

**Jill (Black):**
Good Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è!

I'd love to have it done by the end of the month 4/27/25 if that possible? I'm not in a rush.
